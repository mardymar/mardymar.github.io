This is deprecated. It was made for an interview with hackreactor and is the same as sets-and-cards using pure JS instead of Angular. It was built for Parse, but Parse has since been discontinued and a new Parse server would need to be configured in order for this application to function correctly.


This is a flash card site that stores user-created flash cards into sets. The sets can then be randomly placed, seven at a time, into groups for study. The user can then choose to study any or all of the groups. The random nature of the groups helps with retention since the user does not learn the definition of a word simply by associating it with another word in its set.
